# Pandas Filtering and Sorting Data
Exercise with Pandas Packages (filtering and sorting data)

## Overview
For this exercise, I am practicing with Pandas Packages for filtering and sorting data. This could be useful for someone who take some information from the data based on what they needs.

## Contents
There are several question about filtering and sorting the data such as;
* Print a data frame with only two columns item_name and item_price
* How many times was a Veggie Salad Bowl ordered?
* How many times did someone order more than one Canned Soda?
* Select only the Goal column.
* View only the columns Team, Yellow Cards and Red Cards and assign them to a dataframe called discipline.
* Filter teams that scored more than 6 goals.
* Present only the Shooting Accuracy from England, Italy and Russia.

## Data
I took the dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/DAT8/master/data/chipotle.tsv.
